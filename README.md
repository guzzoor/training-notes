# training-notes
A program where you can save your training results and see your progress. You will also be able to keep track of your food, with kcal and everything that comes with it. Initialy done with the purpose of Java learning. 

The plan is to first program something that works on the computer and later evolve it so an Android app.


Project start: 19-12-2019

Time plan: I'll hopefully be done with the basics in a week.
